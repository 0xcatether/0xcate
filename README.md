# Welcome to 0xCATE website

CatEther introduces a new mechanic: "Proof of Use"

Each time you successfully make a transaction it will create 1 token, sending 0.5 to your address and the other 0.5 to an address of your choice.

If the Donation Address is not set it will be burnt by default.
Free donations, or free CATE transfers: It's up to you.

You can also override the default donation address by calling a specific function : "transferAndDonateTo".
